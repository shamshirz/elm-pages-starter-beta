title: Elm Pages Demo
type: page
---

This is an [`elm-pages`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages) demo site. I was exploring the static site experience particularly in comparison to the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) generator, which we use for [the Sylver Studios Blog](https://sylverstudios.dev/). That does the job, but the developer experience left a lot to be desired.

With `elm-pages` we get the expected type safety and compiler support for the view like you may expect and the really exciting part is that a lot of the static site generation has been brought into compilation! AKA - during development, the compiler will tell you that the env is missing or that a file is named incorrectly instead of requiring you to manually try to visit the pages.

During this project I also tried out [Cloudinary for hosting static images](https://cloudinary.com/) which was very easy. I also had my first real experience with [Elm-Ui](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui) and it was a pleasure!
