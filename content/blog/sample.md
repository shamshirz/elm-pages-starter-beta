So this is elm-pages. Try using code blocks - do they get highlighted correctly?
This page has

* A markdown body
* An image served from an external resource
* Some front matter - author, published, etc


```elixir
def fxn do
  %{alpha: 1}
  |> withBeta
  |> compute()
  |> this_just_tests_code_block_highlighting()
end
```


```elm
plus : number -> number -> number
plus m n =
    m + n
```
