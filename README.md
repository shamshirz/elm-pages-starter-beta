### Questions
* Is `elm-pages` a suitable replacement for jekyll?
  * [compiler + signature > docs example PR](https://github.com/shamshirz/elm-pages-starter-beta/pull/2)

* ‚úÖ Is `elm-pages` a suitable option for personal small projects?
  * > Yes


### If the project continues
* CI - lint, elm-review, elm-test
* Give feedback to Dillon


## Dev Experience
`npm start` == `elm-pages develop`

`npm run build` == `elm-pages-beta` # AKA prod artifact, this is the new part

`npm run serve` - host static files from ‚òùÔ∏è without watch

  <summary>Development Example for others trying out `elm-pages`</summary>

  ### How
I cloned DKs repo and checked out his [Template Modules branch](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages-starter/tree/template-modules)

### Getting Started Example
Started a new page `test.md` and followed the compiler

* frontmatter error on `published: "2020-12-30"` needed quotes around date
* author needed, add
  * > Problem with the value at json.author: "Aaron Votre"
* author image doesn't exist
  * > , avatar = Pages.images.author.aaron (does not have aaron field)
  * Slightly harder to find because that file is generated from the `image/X` directory
* built, but my page stinks
* Wondering how to add custom things inline
  * example - inject a bit of elm defined UI into my markdown
  * discovered in `MarkdownRenderer.elm` you can add custom tags and then it basically gets built like react with uppercase tags
  * `<BOX>` example and [this article on the elm markdown rendered](https://elm-pages.com/blog/extensible-markdown-parsing-in-elm)
